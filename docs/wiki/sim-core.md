# Sim core + hit pipeline
Purpose: deterministic game rules, separate from presentation. Same seed + inputs = same world.

## Files
- `src/core/sim.ts`, `types.ts`, `rng.ts`, `view.ts`, `stats.ts` (rollHit), `autoplay.ts` (bot)
- `src/core/sim/`: `hit.ts` (hitEnemy, killEnemy), `enemies.ts`, `shots.ts`, `throw.ts`, `boss.ts`, `danger.ts`, `ctx.ts`, `spawn.ts`
- `src/core/knockback.ts`, `src/content/{enemies,bosses,breads}.ts`

## How it works
- One `rngState` threaded through the tick; presentation reads events and `view.ts`.
- Hit: base x mods x crit x takenMul; shield before HP; continuous projectile sweep; per-projectile hit set.
- Knockback is finite and decelerating (experiment, `knockback.ts`).
- Kannan's hurt zone is `FIELD.kannanHitHalfWidth` = 30 u (half-width; was 34, about 12% smaller). It gates enemy shots and boss volleys landing on the counter (`enemies.ts`, `danger.ts`, `boss.ts` tells). Pickup and reach radii are untouched. The drawn sprite is unchanged (`KANNAN_W` 0.54 of width). Balance (300 seeds, `balance.test.ts`): four breads 67%, two breads 48%, solo Kosong 17%; signatures murtabak 23%, appam 18%, roti-bomb 15%; hawker-night boosted four breads 56%. All in band. 26 u (about 24% smaller) pushed four breads to 92%, two breads 88% and solo Kosong 40%, out of band, so it was not kept.
- Bosses: five attack kinds (volley, charge, summon, rain, sweep), phase on HP only.

## Status
Live. Last change 2026-10-14 (hurt zone 34 -> 30 u; blast damage cues, picks counter). Tests: `src/core/__tests__/`.

## Research
- Used: [decomp-mechanisms](../research/decomp-mechanisms.md) (sweep, knockback glide), [game-feel](../research/game-feel.md).
- Not yet (see [decomp-status](../research/decomp-status.md)): staged hit pipeline with trace, named RNG streams, crit tiers, stat-stage table, boss Emitter + timeout phases, hit i-frames, flat DT armour.

## TODO
- `hitEnemy` is a monolith; single RNG stream.
